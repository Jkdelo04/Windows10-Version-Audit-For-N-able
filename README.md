# Asset Report Parser

## Overview
This program is designed to parse and process data from the Asset report generated by N-able. It identifies computers on Windows 10, compiles a list of computer names and their CPU information, and organizes this data by customer. The output is saved as an Excel workbook, allowing for easy identification of computers needing upgrades to Windows 11 or replacement due to age.

## How to Generate the Asset Report
1. Navigate to the N-able platform.
2. Go to `Reports > Asset > Asset Site`.
3. Export the report in CSV format.
